# History Greetings Bot

A little robot, powered by a Raspberry Pi Model 3B+, that will stand outside my office and greet passers by with bits of history trivia and quotes.

## Required Components

- [X] ~~Motion recognition software (likely solution: [Motion](https://github.com/Motion-Project)) (May look into this [ruby plugin](https://github.com/jrobertson/humble_rpi-plugin-pir/))~~ Decided to go with a PIR sensor solution instead
- [X] Software solution to trigger audio with perceived motion - See code folder
- [ ] Generate range of responses: historical facts, quotes

### Progress Notes

08-26-2019: A frustrating day at the office; Motion is giving me problems and it looks like I have a hardware failure on the Raspberry Pi camera. I was already thinking of going a different direction, but perhaps that decision has been made for me.

08-28-2019: Two more incredibly frustrating days... followed by success!!! I think I know Python now. I now have a bot that will fire out Jeff Daniels performing Lincoln at strangers.
